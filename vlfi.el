;;; Commentary:

;; This package used to provide the M-x vlfi command, which visited
;; part of a large file without loading the entire file.
;; However, it has been merged back to the vlf package,
;; so use that instead.

;;; Code:

;;;###autoload
(error
 "This package has been merged with vlf: please install that instead")

;;; vlfi.el ends here
