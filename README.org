* View Large File

An Emacs mode that allows viewing files in chunks.  This is a fork
that builds on the GNU ELPA vlf.el.

* Usage tips

When opening file, by default Emacs checks its size against
`large-file-warning-threshold' and if larger asks for confirmation.
To add vlf as an option in these cases:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(if (fboundp 'vlf-if-file-too-large)
    (fset 'abort-if-file-too-large 'vlf-if-file-too-large))
#+END_SRC
