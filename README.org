* View Large Files Improved

An Emacs mode that allows viewing, editing and searching in large
files in chunks.  Batch size can be adjusted on the fly and bounds the
memory that is to be used for operations on the file.

This is a fork that builds on the bare bones GNU ELPA vlf.el.  It adds
the following improvements:

- proper dealing with Unicode
- regular expression search on whole file (in constant memory
  determined by current batch size)
- chunk editing (if size has changed, saving is done in constant
  memory determined by current batch size)
- options to jump to beginning, end or arbitrary file chunk
- ability to jump/insert given number of batches at once
- newly added content is acknowledged if file has changed size
  meanwhile
- automatic scrolling of batches
- vlfi is added as an option when opening large files
